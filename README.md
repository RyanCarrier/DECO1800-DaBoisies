## Running
### Where is the server!?
Unix extract with `./extract.sh` \*

Windows install 7zip or some shit and extract it to the same directory

### How do I run it
Unix run your arch's executable from terminal

Windows, double click it

### Moar help still no work
#### Windows
run as admin

#### Mac
Open terminal from Utilities, or press `âŒ˜+Space` and type Terminal

navigate to the directory it's stored in using `cd` (change directory); ie, if you cloned to your downloads folder `cd Downloads/DECO1800-DaBoisies`

extract the archive `./extract.sh`

run the server `./darwinServer`

If it tells you to check your priveledge run `sudo ./darwinServer` then enter you password when prompted

## Editing
### I edited the server!
run `./buildAll.sh` with a 64bit golang install before committing

### I edited the HTML!
Refresh your browser

### I edited the javascript!
Refresh your browser

\* But ryan, why would you have a one line script just to extract a zip. Fuck you I'm lazy that's why

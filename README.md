## Running
### Where is the server!?
Unix extract with `./extract.sh` \*

Windows install 7zip or some shit and extract it to the same directory

### How do I run it
Unix run your arch's executable from terminal

Windows, double click it

## Editing
### I edited the server!
run `./buildAll.sh` with a 64bit golang install before committing

### I edited the HTML!
Refresh your browser

### I edited the javascript!
Refresh your browser

\* But ryan, why would you have a one line script just to extract a zip. Fuck you I'm lazy that's why
